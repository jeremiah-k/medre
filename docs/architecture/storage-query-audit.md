## Section 1: Overview

This audit identifies every SQL query shape exercised by MEDRE's CLI and runtime
commands, evaluates index coverage for each, and documents N+1 query patterns.
The goal is to ensure hot query paths are covered by indexes without over-indexing
columns that are never filtered on.

### Tables

| Table | Row count estimate | Primary key |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| `canonical_events` | Per-event (grows with volume) | `event_id TEXT` |
| `event_relations` | 0–N per event | `id INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT` |
| `native_message_refs` | 0–N per event | `id TEXT` + `UNIQUE(adapter, native_channel_id, native_message_id)` |
| `delivery_receipts` | 1–N per event per adapter (append-only) | `sequence INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT` |
| `plugin_state` | Static / low volume | `PRIMARY KEY(plugin_id, key)` |

### Existing indexes (pre-audit)

| Index | Columns | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `idx_events_timestamp` | `(timestamp, event_id)` | Event timeline ORDER BY |
| `idx_relations_event_id` | `(event_id, id)` | Relation lookup per event |
| `idx_nrefs_event_id` | `(event_id)` | Native ref lookup per event |
| `idx_receipts_plan` | `(delivery_plan_id, target_adapter, attempt_number, sequence)` | Plan receipt queries + delivery_status view |
| `idx_receipts_event` | `(event_id, sequence)` | Receipt lookup per event |
| `idx_receipts_source` | `(source, replay_run_id)` | Source+run filtering |

---

## Section 2: Query Table

Every distinct query shape found across the audited files.

| # | Query | Table(s) | WHERE columns | ORDER BY | Frequency | Indexed? | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Q1 | `get(event_id)` | `canonical_events` | `event_id = ?` | — | per-inspect, per-trace, per-replay, per-evidence | ✅ PK | Hottest single-row lookup |
| Q2 | `list_relations(event_id)` | `event_relations` | `event_id = ?` | `id ASC` | per-trace, per-recover, per-evidence | ✅ idx_relations_event_id | |
| Q3 | `resolve_native_ref` | `native_message_refs` | `adapter = ?, native_channel_id IS ?, native_message_id = ?` | — | per-dedup-check, per-receipt in evidence | ✅ UNIQUE autoindex | Covers NULL channel via `IS ?` |
| Q4 | `delivery_status(plan, adapter)` | `delivery_status` VIEW → `delivery_receipts` self-join | `delivery_plan_id = ?, target_adapter = ?` | — | per-delivery-check | ✅ idx_receipts_plan | View subquery groups by (plan, adapter) |
| Q5 | `list_receipts_for_plan` | `delivery_receipts` | `delivery_plan_id = ?, target_adapter = ?` | `attempt_number ASC, sequence ASC` | per-plan-inspect | ✅ idx_receipts_plan | |
| Q6 | `list_receipts_by_replay_run` | `delivery_receipts` | `replay_run_id = ?` | `sequence ASC` | per-trace-replay, per-inspect, per-evidence | ❌ **MISSING** | `idx_receipts_source(source, replay_run_id)` cannot serve `replay_run_id` alone; full scan |
| Q7 | `list_receipts_for_event` | `delivery_receipts` | `event_id = ?` | `sequence ASC` | per-trace, per-inspect, per-recover, per-evidence, per-poll | ✅ idx_receipts_event | Hottest receipt query |
| Q8 | `list_native_refs_for_event` | `native_message_refs` | `event_id = ?` | `created_at ASC` | per-trace, per-recover, per-evidence | ⚠️ Partial | `idx_nrefs_event_id(event_id)` covers WHERE but ORDER BY `created_at` requires extra sort |
| Q9 | `query(EventFilter)` | `canonical_events` | Dynamic: `event_kind IN`, `source_adapter IN`, `timestamp >=`, `timestamp <=` | `timestamp ASC` | per-replay, per-broad-query | ✅ idx_events_timestamp | Compound filters; index covers timestamp range + ORDER BY |
| Q10 | `query() relations batch` | `event_relations` | `event_id IN (?)` | — | per-query (batch) | ✅ idx_relations_event_id | Batch fetch after Q9 |
| Q11 | `count_events` | `canonical_events` | — | — | per-evidence | N/A | Full scan, acceptable |
| Q12 | `count_receipts` | `delivery_receipts` | — | — | per-evidence | N/A | Full scan, acceptable |
| Q13 | `list_due_retry_receipts` | `delivery_receipts` | `status = 'failed', failure_kind = 'adapter_transient', next_retry_at IS NOT NULL, next_retry_at <= ?` | `next_retry_at ASC` | per-RetryWorker-cycle | ⚠️ No dedicated index | RetryWorker polls this on each cycle; `idx_receipts_event` and `idx_receipts_plan` do not cover these columns |

## Section 3: Findings

### F1: Missing index — `delivery_receipts.replay_run_id`

- **Query affected:** Q6 (`_SELECT_RECEIPTS_BY_REPLAY_RUN`)
- **WHERE:** `replay_run_id = ?` (no `source` filter)
- **Current index:** `idx_receipts_source(source, replay_run_id)` — leading column is `source`, so this index **cannot** serve queries that filter `replay_run_id` alone
- **Callers:** `trace_commands._trace_replay`, `inspect_commands._inspect_receipts`, `runtime/evidence._collect_storage_section`
- **Impact:** Full table scan of `delivery_receipts` on every replay-run query. `delivery_receipts` is the highest-volume append-only table.
- **Severity:** Medium-High

### F2: Suboptimal index — `native_message_refs(event_id)` vs `(event_id, created_at)`

- **Query affected:** Q8 (`_SELECT_NREFS_FOR_EVENT`)
- **WHERE:** `event_id = ?`
- **ORDER BY:** `created_at ASC`
- **Current index:** `idx_nrefs_event_id(event_id)` — covers the WHERE but SQLite must sort results by `created_at` after the index scan
- **Callers:** `trace_commands._trace_event`, `recover_commands._recover`, `runtime/evidence._collect_storage_section`, `run_session/evidence._collect_native_refs`
- **Impact:** Minor — result sets per event are typically small. But the fix is trivial: extend the index to include `created_at` as the second column, eliminating the sort entirely.
- **Severity:** Low

### F3: N+1 pattern — `trace_commands._trace_replay` (lines 112–117)

- **Pattern:** After fetching receipts by `replay_run_id`, iterates over unique `event_id` values and calls `storage.get(eid)` individually for each.
- **Impact:** N round-trips to SQLite (one per distinct event in the replay run). For large replay runs this can be significant.
- **Fix suggestion:** Use a single `query()` call with `EventFilter` or add a batch `get_many()` method that does `WHERE event_id IN (...)`. The `query()` method already does this batch-fetch for relations.
- **Severity:** Medium

### F4: N+1 pattern — `run_session/evidence._collect_native_refs` (lines 166–171)

- **Pattern:** After fetching `list_native_refs_for_event(event_id)`, iterates over each outbound ref and calls `storage.resolve_native_ref(adapter, channel, message)` individually.
- **Impact:** Each `resolve_native_ref` is a single-row lookup (covered by UNIQUE index), so performance is acceptable. But the N+1 pattern is wasteful when many refs exist.
- **Fix suggestion:** The resolve calls are verification-only (confirming each ref still resolves). Consider whether this verification is necessary or if the initial `list_native_refs_for_event` result is sufficient.
- **Severity:** Low

### F5: N+1 pattern — `replay.py ReplayEngine._iter_by_ids` (lines 1037–1048)

- **Pattern:** For `correlation_ids` replay, fetches each event individually via `storage.get(eid)` in a loop.
- **Impact:** N round-trips. Same root cause as F3 — no batch get method.
- **Fix suggestion:** Same as F3 — batch `get_many()` or `WHERE event_id IN (...)`.
- **Severity:** Medium

### F6: N+1 pattern — `replay.py ReplayEngine.count_matching` (lines 1004–1010)

- **Pattern:** Same as F5 but for counting. Each `storage.get(eid)` fetches the full event just to check filters.
- **Fix suggestion:** Batch fetch with post-filtering.
- **Severity:** Low (counting is less frequent than replay)

### F7: No redundant indexes found

- All existing indexes serve distinct query shapes. No duplicates or fully-overlapping indexes.

### F8: Missing index for RetryWorker query (Q13)

- **Query affected:** Q13 (`list_due_retry_receipts`)
- **WHERE:** `status = 'failed' AND failure_kind = 'adapter_transient' AND next_retry_at IS NOT NULL AND next_retry_at <= ?`
- **ORDER BY:** `next_retry_at ASC`
- **Current index coverage:** No existing index covers the retry query filter columns. The RetryWorker polls this on each cycle, requiring a scan filtered by `status`, `failure_kind`, and `next_retry_at`.
- **Callers:** RetryWorker cycle loop
- **Impact:** Scans `delivery_receipts` on each RetryWorker cycle. For small-to-moderate receipt volumes this is acceptable. For high-volume deployments with many pending retries, consider adding a partial index:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_receipts_retry_due
      ON delivery_receipts(next_retry_at)
      WHERE status = 'failed' AND failure_kind = 'adapter_transient' AND next_retry_at IS NOT NULL;
  ```
- **Severity:** Low-Medium (depends on receipt volume and retry frequency)

### F9: No unindexed JOIN foreign keys

- `event_relations.event_id` → `canonical_events.event_id`: covered by `idx_relations_event_id`
- `native_message_refs.event_id` → `canonical_events.event_id`: covered by `idx_nrefs_event_id` (and proposed replacement)
- `delivery_receipts.event_id` → `canonical_events.event_id`: covered by `idx_receipts_event`

### F10: No ORDER BY on unindexed columns in hot paths

- `timestamp ASC` on `canonical_events`: covered by `idx_events_timestamp`
- `sequence ASC` on `delivery_receipts`: covered by PK or composite indexes
- `created_at ASC` on `native_message_refs`: addressed by F2

## Section 4: Recommendations

### R1: Add `idx_receipts_replay_run` (HIGH priority)

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_receipts_replay_run
    ON delivery_receipts(replay_run_id);
```

- **Why:** Query Q6 filters by `replay_run_id` alone. The existing `idx_receipts_source(source, replay_run_id)` cannot serve this because `source` is not in the WHERE clause. Every `trace replay`, `inspect --replay-run`, and evidence bundle with a replay_run_id triggers a full table scan.
- **Queries benefited:** Q6
- **Estimated impact:** Full scan → index seek. Impact grows linearly with receipt table size.

### R2: Replace `idx_nrefs_event_id` with `idx_nrefs_event_created` (LOW priority)

```sql
-- Remove old:
-- CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_nrefs_event_id ON native_message_refs(event_id);
-- Add new:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_nrefs_event_created
    ON native_message_refs(event_id, created_at);
```

- **Why:** Query Q8 filters by `event_id` and orders by `created_at ASC`. A composite index on `(event_id, created_at)` eliminates the in-memory sort. The old single-column index `(event_id)` is a strict prefix of the new one, so the new index is strictly more useful.
- **Queries benefited:** Q8
- **Estimated impact:** Minor — result sets per event are small. Eliminates a sort step.
- **Implementation:** Add the new index and remove the old one. SQLite `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` + `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in the `_INDEXES` block.

### R3: Document N+1 patterns for future improvement (no code change)

The N+1 patterns (F3, F5, F6) are in CLI and replay code paths that are not in the hot runtime delivery loop. They affect operator-facing commands (trace, evidence, replay) rather than per-event delivery. A batch `get_many()` method on `SQLiteStorage` would fix all three patterns simultaneously, but this is an optimization, not a correctness issue.

## Section 5: Lineage Ordering Guarantees

This section documents the deterministic ordering properties that underpin
receipt lineage, event replay traceability, and evidence bundle assembly.

### Receipts: ORDER BY sequence ASC (deterministic, append-only)

`delivery_receipts.sequence` is an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.  Every
receipt is assigned a monotonically increasing sequence at INSERT time.  Ordering
by `sequence ASC` is deterministic and stable across restarts: SQLite
auto-increment never reuses a value from a previous session.  All receipt query
paths use this ordering.

### Events: ORDER BY timestamp ASC, event_id ASC tiebreaker

Event queries use `ORDER BY timestamp ASC, event_id ASC`.  The `event_id`
tiebreaker ensures deterministic ordering when two events share the same logical
timestamp (set by the source adapter).  Events are ordered by their logical
occurrence time, not by storage insertion time.

### Native refs: ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC tiebreaker

Native message refs for an event are ordered by `created_at ASC, id ASC`.  The
`id` tiebreaker ensures deterministic ordering when multiple refs share the same
timestamp.  Index `idx_nrefs_event_id(event_id)` covers the WHERE clause;
recommendation R2 proposes extending it to cover the ORDER BY as well.

### Replay receipts: grouped by replay_run_id

Every replay receipt has `source='replay'` and a non-null `replay_run_id`.  All
receipts produced by a single `medre replay --mode BEST_EFFORT` invocation share
the same `replay_run_id`.  Multiple BEST_EFFORT runs of the same events produce
different `replay_run_id` values.  The `replay_run_id` is unique per run, never
null for replay receipts, and never shared across runs.  Replay receipts are not
grouped in sequence space; they are interleaved with live receipts in append
order.

### Live/replay interleaving: determined by sequence (append order)

Replay receipts are stored in the same `delivery_receipts` table as live
receipts.  Because `sequence` is assigned at INSERT time, replay receipts always
have a higher sequence than any receipt inserted before them.  When live events
are injected between replay runs, the sequence ordering reflects true append
order:

```
...original live (seq 1..160)...
...replay run A (seq 161..166)...
...new live events (seq 167..176)...
...replay run B (seq 177..182)...
```

This ordering is deterministic across restart because `sequence` values are
persistent in SQLite and never reused.

### Ordering stability across restart

`sequence` is an auto-increment integer stored in the SQLite database file.  It
survives crashes and restarts.  After restart, new receipts continue from the
next auto-increment value with no gap filling.  Gaps in the sequence indicate
lost in-flight deliveries (no receipt was written).

`replay_run_id` is an operator-assigned string (or auto-generated UUID).  It is
stored on each replay receipt and persists across restarts.  Repeated replays of
the same event produce distinct `replay_run_id` values, making each run
independently traceable.


### Indexes NOT recommended

| Column | Why not |
|--------|---------|
| `canonical_events.event_kind` | Low-cardinality column; query Q9 always has ORDER BY timestamp which uses `idx_events_timestamp` |
| `canonical_events.source_adapter` | Low-cardinality; always combined with timestamp range in practice |
| `canonical_events.parent_event_id` | Never used in a WHERE clause |
| `delivery_receipts.parent_receipt_id` | Never used in a WHERE clause |
| `delivery_receipts.status` | Low-cardinality; never queried alone |
