# Unreleased Changes

Pre-release MEDRE. All changes below are unreleased and subject to change

## Transport Capability Semantics and Delivery Evidence

Document implemented transport capability semantics, rendering budget
behavior, suppression/truncation evidence, relation/reaction degradation,
replay parity expectations, and unknown capability behavior.

**Changed:**

- `docs/spec/adapter-runtime.md`: CapabilityLevel decision mapping,
  evidence signal descriptions.
- `docs/spec/routing-delivery.md`: unknown event kind passthrough,
  fail-closed for unknown relation types, dormant fallback gap.
- `docs/spec/diagnostics-evidence.md`: capability-evidence derivation,
  rendering budget enforcement and evidence.
- `docs/spec/conformance.md`: transport capability conformance table.
- `docs/spec/appendices/transport-limitations.md`: capability semantics
  known gaps.
- `docs/ops/recovery-and-replay.md`: capability filtering during replay.
- `docs/ops/troubleshooting.md`: capability suppressed diagnosis.
- `docs/ops/operator-workflows.md`: capability_suppressed failure kind.

## Queued Delivery Outbox Correlation and Terminal Outcome Reporting

Add exact `outbox_id`/`attempt_number` correlation for async queued
adapters, stale callback protection, terminal queue outcome reporting,
and remove `delivery_plan_id=None` legacy fallback.

---

## Retry Route-Decision Parity

Persist route-decision metadata in outbox item metadata at creation time
and recover it during retry reconstruction so retry delivery matches the
original live delivery decision.

---

## OutboxManager Extraction

Extract outbox lifecycle operations from `PipelineRunner` into a dedicated
`OutboxManager` module. Pure refactoring — no behavior changes.

---

## Meshtastic Configurable Packet Routing

Add configurable packet classification policy to the Meshtastic adapter.

---

## Adapter Ingress Evidence Parity

Harden post-stop ingress behavior and fill LXMF diagnostics evidence gaps.

---

## MeshCore Per-Contact Retry Timeout Cache Clear

Clear MeshCore per-contact retry timeout cache on reconnect and
failed-start cleanup.

---

## Matrix Adapter start() Lifecycle Cleanup

Roll back Matrix adapter lifecycle fields on failed start; move started
log after completion.

---

## Adapter Startup Lifecycle Cleanup

Harden start-failure cleanup across MeshCore, LXMF, and Meshtastic
adapters to match the Matrix pattern.

---

## MeshCore BLE Reconnect Fix

Fix BLE connection failures on Linux BlueZ stacks where
le-connection-abort-by-local errors abort the initial connect, and
stale BlueZ state prevents reconnect.

---

## Relay Attribution Prefix — Transport Profile Documentation

Document cross-transport relay attribution prefix model, config fields,
and truncation semantics for all four transports.

**New config fields:**

- `meshcore_relay_prefix` (string, default `""`)
- `lxmf_relay_prefix` (string, default `""`)

---

## LXMF Announce Interval Configuration

Add configurable periodic LXMF announce interval for mesh path discovery.

**New config field:** `announce_interval_seconds` (float, default `600.0`).

---

## origin_label — Platform-Neutral Source Label

Added platform-neutral `origin_label` to all adapter configs. Matrix
prefix is now target-local via `MatrixConfig.relay_prefix`. LXMF renderer
is target-aware.

**New config fields:**

- `origin_label` (string, default `""`) on all four adapter configs.
- `relay_prefix` (string, default `""`) on `MatrixConfig`.

---

## Remove meshnet_name and matrix_relay_prefix from MeshtasticConfig

Removed `matrix_relay_prefix` from `MeshtasticConfig`. Removed
`meshnet_name` from all transport profile config tables and prefix
template variable tables. `{origin_label}` is the single MEDRE-generic
source label.

**Breaking:** existing configs with `meshnet_name` or `matrix_relay_prefix`
will not load. Rename `meshnet_name` to `origin_label` and move
`matrix_relay_prefix` to `MatrixConfig.relay_prefix`.

---

## Clean Attribution Surface — Canonical Variables Only

Finalized the attribution surface to use only canonical template
variables. Old variables (`{longname}`, `{shortname}`, `{shortname5}`,
`{from_id}`, `{meshnet_name}`) are unknown placeholders.

**Canonical variables:** `{sender}`, `{sender_short}`, `{sender_id}`,
`{sender_handle}`, `{platform}`, `{route_id}`, `{channel}`,
`{origin_label}`.

mmrelay `KEY_MESHNET` is an isolated wire-compatibility field, not a
MEDRE attribution variable.

---

## Direction-aware Route Origin Labels

Replace the single `origin_label` route field with direction-aware
`source_origin_label` and `dest_origin_label`.

- `source_origin_label`: applied to forward legs (source→dest).
- `dest_origin_label`: applied to reverse legs (dest→source).
- Both default to `None` (fall back to adapter `origin_label`).

Per-channel origin labels are not implemented. Use separate routes per
channel.

---

## Adapter Projection / Core Boundary Documentation

Document the structural boundary between core rendering (generic
`RelayAttribution`) and adapter-adjacent native projection. Document the
`origin_label` precedence chain.

---

## Dispatch Refactor, platform_hint, Explicit Empty Labels

Refactored attribution dispatch to be truly dispatch-only: detects
platform and delegates to per-adapter projection helpers with no
cross-platform identity enrichment. Wired `platform_hint` from
`SourceAttributionConfig`. Preserved explicit empty origin labels
(`""` = suppress, `None` = unset). Cleaned MatrixRenderer registration
to be Matrix-config-driven.

- `_attribution_dispatch.py`: detects platform, delegates to adapter
  projection helpers, returns projected fields. No global flat-key
  fallback — each adapter handles its own native keys.
- `project_source_fields` / `detect_source_platform`: accept `platform_hint`.
- All renderers: `is not None` checks for `ctx.source_origin_label`.
- `derive_meshnet_value`: `is not None` checks.
- MatrixRenderer: registers when Matrix configs exist (not Meshtastic).
- Underscore-prefixed adapter modules treated as shared infrastructure.
