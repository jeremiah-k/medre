# Matrix Transport Profile

## Purpose and Role

The Matrix adapter is a **presentation adapter** (`AdapterRole.PRESENTATION`) that connects to a Matrix homeserver via the `mindroom-nio` async client library. It bridges inbound Matrix room messages into the MEDRE canonical event stream and delivers outbound rendered payloads back to Matrix rooms.

The adapter delegates all client lifecycle (creation, login, sync, teardown) to `MatrixSession`. Semantic conversion (codec decode/encode, event classification) is owned by the adapter itself.

**Platform identifier:** `matrix`

## Relay Attribution Prefix

The Matrix renderer prepends a human-readable relay attribution prefix to the
message body when the **source adapter's** config provides a prefix template.
The prefix is NOT configured on `MatrixConfig` — it comes from the source
adapter's configuration, resolved via the renderer's `source_configs` mapping.

**Current config source:** When the source is a Meshtastic adapter, the
template is `MeshtasticConfig.matrix_relay_prefix` (default
`"[{longname}/{meshnet_name}]: "`). When no source config is found (e.g.
event from an adapter not in the `source_configs` mapping), no prefix is
prepended. MeshCore and LXMF source adapters do not contribute a Matrix
outbound prefix in this release — only `MeshtasticConfig` carries
`matrix_relay_prefix`. This policy may be extended to other source
adapters in a future release.

**Template syntax:** `{placeholder}` variables resolved by the shared core
formatter (`format_relay_prefix`) against `RelayAttribution` extracted from
the source event. See the Meshtastic Transport Profile §Relay Attribution
Prefix for the authoritative list of supported template variables and
formatting rules.

**Application points:**

1. Direct mode body (before truncation).
2. Fallback-text mode body (before truncation).
3. Reaction emote body (via `_format_reaction_prefix`).

**Truncation:** The Matrix renderer has no constrained radio byte budget.
Prefix length is unconstrained in the renderer, though Matrix homeservers
impose their own event size limits. When a `RenderingContext` text budget is
active (`max_text_chars` or `max_text_bytes`), the prefix counts toward that
budget.

**Metadata keys** (when prefix is configured):

| Key                              | Value                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `relay_prefix_template`          | Original template string               |
| `relay_prefix_rendered`          | Rendered prefix string                 |
| `relay_prefix_variables_used`    | Tuple of template variables resolved   |
| `relay_prefix_missing_variables` | Tuple of variables that resolved empty |
| `relay_prefix_unknown_variables` | Tuple of unknown placeholder names     |
| `relay_prefix_formatting_error`  | Error string or `None`                 |

**Attribution caveat:** The prefix is human-readable attribution only. It
does not constitute delivery evidence. The MEDRE metadata envelope
(`medre.envelope`) remains the authoritative source for machine-readable
provenance. Matrix `room_send` success confirms local homeserver acceptance
only — it does not confirm remote delivery or federation fan-out.

---

The Matrix codec (`MatrixCodec`) decodes three inbound categories:

1. **True Matrix reactions** (`m.annotation` in `m.relates_to`) → `MESSAGE_REACTED` with a `reaction` relation targeting the annotated event.
2. **MMRelay emote reactions** (`m.emote` with `meshtastic_replyId` and `meshtastic_emoji == 1`) → `MESSAGE_REACTED` with a canonical reaction relation carrying MMRelay metadata.
3. **Regular messages** (including replies) → `MESSAGE_CREATED`. Reply fallback body is stripped.

---

## Supported Outbound Event Kinds

The Matrix renderer (`MatrixRenderer`) produces:

- **Plain text messages** — `m.room.message` with `m.text` msgtype, optional relay prefix, and MEDRE metadata envelope.
- **Native replies** — `m.relates_to.m.in_reply_to` with `event_id`, plus `KEY_REPLY_ID` when MMRelay metadata is available.
- **Native reactions** — `m.reaction` event type (via internal `_matrix_event_type` key) with `m.annotation`.
- **MMRelay emote reaction fallback** — `m.emote` with `KEY_EMOJI=1`, `KEY_REPLY_ID`, and full mesh metadata (used when `mmrelay_compatibility=True` or no Matrix-native target exists).

---

## Native Reference Format

- **Inbound native ref:** `NativeRef(adapter=<id>, native_channel_id=<room_id>, native_message_id=<event_id>)`
- **Outbound native ref:** Returned from `deliver()` as `AdapterDeliveryResult.native_message_id` (the Matrix `event_id` from `RoomSendResponse`).
- **Deterministic transaction ID:** `medre_<sha256[:32]>` computed from `result.event_id + target_adapter + target_channel + room_id`. The homeserver deduplicates within its transaction-ID window.

---

## Delivery Semantics

**Local acceptance:** `deliver()` performs a synchronous `room_send` with bounded retry (up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff 500 ms → 1 s → 2 s with ±25 % jitter). Success means the homeserver accepted the event and returned an `event_id`.

**Remote delivery:** The homeserver is responsible for fan-out. MEDRE treats the returned `event_id` as confirmation of _local acceptance only_ — it does not track whether other federation servers or clients received the event.

**Rate-limit handling:** `M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` / HTTP 429 raises `AdapterSendError(transient=True)` immediately so the pipeline retry worker can honour `retry_after_ms`.

**Permanent errors** (`M_FORBIDDEN`, `M_NOT_FOUND`, encrypted-room without crypto, etc.) raise `AdapterPermanentError` without retry.

---

## Session Lifecycle

1. **Disconnected** — Initial state; `session=None`.
2. **Connecting** — `start()` creates `MatrixSession`, calls `session.start()`. Session creates nio `AsyncClient`, restores login via `restore_login()`, registers callbacks, starts sync task.
3. **Live (pre-sync)** — After `start()` returns, the first sync is in progress. `session.is_live` is `False`; inbound events are suppressed as backlog.
4. **Live (syncing)** — First successful sync with `next_batch` token sets `is_live = True`. Subsequent inbound events are processed normally.
5. **Reconnecting** — Sync failure triggers bounded exponential backoff (1 s → 2 s → 4 s → … capped at 60 s, ±25 % jitter, max 10 consecutive attempts).
6. **Stopped** — `stop()` cancels sync task, disconnects client, nulls session. Idempotent.

**E2EE modes:**

- `plaintext` — No crypto; `ignore_unverified_devices=False`.
- `e2ee_required` — Fails if `mindroom-nio[e2e]` not installed or crypto subsystem broken.
- `e2ee_optional` — Attempts crypto; falls back to plaintext with `crypto_enabled=False` on failure.

## Relation Degradation Behavior

Matrix is a presentation adapter with rich native relation support. The Matrix renderer handles all rendering within its native format.

| Relation type | Capability level | Strategy | Rendering path                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Replies       | `"native"`       | `direct` | `m.in_reply_to` with `event_id` in `m.relates_to`                 |
| Reactions     | `"native"`       | `direct` | `m.reaction` event type with `m.annotation`                       |
| Edits         | `"unsupported"`  | `skip`   | No delivery. Edit events targeting this adapter are suppressed.   |
| Deletes       | `"unsupported"`  | `skip`   | No delivery. Delete events targeting this adapter are suppressed. |
| Threads       | _deferred_       | —        | Reserved. Not rendered by any adapter in this branch.             |

Matrix does not currently declare the `"fallback"` capability level for any relation type in its capability JSON. All relations are either native or unsupported. When a relation type is unsupported, the delivery is skipped entirely at the planning stage. Because the capability profile does not advertise fallback, the live planner will not normally select `fallback_text` for this adapter.

If a future profile revision or a directly constructed `RenderingContext` supplies `fallback_text` for a relation, the Matrix renderer would produce its native message format with the relation context embedded as inline text. This is a renderer contract, not a test-only quirk; any code path that populates `fallback_text` on a routed relation triggers the same inline-text rendering path.

**Thread deferral:** The `"thread"` relation type is defined in the canonical event model (`VALID_RELATION_TYPES`), but no adapter currently renders thread relations natively. However, fallback-text rendering for threads is implemented: when `delivery_strategy == "fallback_text"`, thread relations are degraded into inline text (e.g. `[thread: {target}] {payload_text}`). Matrix has the underlying protocol support (`m.thread`) but does not exercise it. Thread capability requires a future `AdapterCapabilities.threads` field and planner-level thread routing before any adapter can advertise or render threads natively. Until then, thread relations are reserved and not capability-driven.

**Payload requirement:** The Matrix renderer produces Matrix-native payloads (`m.room.message` with msgtype/body/`m.relates_to`). The adapter transports these payloads via `room_send` without modification.

---

## Known Limitations

- **No edits or deletes.** The capabilities declare `edits="unsupported"` and `deletes="unsupported"`.
- **Duplicate-send risk.** The deterministic `tx_id` reduces duplicates within the homeserver's dedup window, but duplicates are still possible across restarts, replay, or changed delivery identity.
- **nio cross-signing.** `mindroom-nio` lacks MSC1756 cross-signing support; `ignore_unverified_devices=True` is set internally when E2EE is active.
- **No attachment support.** `attachments=False` in capabilities.
- **Room-state tracking cap.** Maximum 10 000 rooms tracked in session `_room_states`; oldest evicted on overflow.
- **Self-message suppression** only matches `config.user_id`; bot-to-bot echoes from other Matrix users are not suppressed.

---

## Duplicate-Send Risk Level

**Low–Medium.** Deterministic transaction IDs provide within-window dedup on the homeserver. Cross-restart replay or delivery identity changes can still produce duplicates. The adapter does not implement application-level dedup beyond `tx_id`.

---

## Validation Status

- Config validation enforces: non-empty `homeserver` (http/https), `user_id` starting with `@`, non-empty `access_token`, valid `encryption_mode`, valid `auto_join_rooms` entries (canonical `!localpart:server` form).
- Sidecar credential fallback from `~/.config/medre/credentials/matrix.json` when config fields are empty.
- Adapter unit tests cover codec decode for all three event categories, renderer output, session lifecycle, delivery retry, and E2EE mode guards.
