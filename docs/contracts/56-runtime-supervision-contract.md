# Contract 56 — Runtime Supervision Contract

**Status:** v1 Implementation — Deterministic health classification and failure severity only
**Scope:** Runtime-level health aggregation, fatal vs non-fatal adapter failure classification, startup outcome semantics, and architectural boundary enforcement for the MEDRE runtime.
**Audience:** Runtime builders, adapter authors, operators, test authors.
**References:** Contract 47 (Runtime Assembly), Contract 48 (Runtime Observability), Contract 54 (Runtime Shutdown), Contract 29 (Diagnostics Contract).

**Non-guarantees (explicit):** This contract does not provide automatic adapter restart, supervisor trees, process respawn, admin API, REST/TUI/daemon management, hot reload, distributed orchestration, or transport redesign. The supervision layer is classification and observability only.

**Post-start supervision scope (explicit):** MEDRE can classify supplied adapter health states after startup — the pure classification functions (`classify_runtime_health`, `classify_adapter_failure_severity`, `runtime_supervision_snapshot`) accept arbitrary `AdapterState` sequences and return deterministic results at any time. However, active post-start failure detection, health refresh polling, and automatic runtime state transitions in response to adapter state changes are **not implemented** in this tranche. Calling these functions with different state values demonstrates classification correctness; it does not imply that the runtime actively detects or reacts to adapter failures at runtime.

## 1. Runtime Health Model

The runtime health is a single enumerated value derived deterministically from the aggregate states of all registered adapters.

### 1.1 RuntimeHealth Enum

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `HEALTHY` | All adapters are in `READY` state. The runtime is fully operational. |
| `DEGRADED` | At least one adapter is operational (`READY`), but at least one adapter is not. The runtime continues with reduced capacity. |
| `FAILED` | All adapters are in `FAILED` state, or zero adapters are registered. The runtime cannot route events. |

### 1.2 Classification Rules

`classify_runtime_health(adapter_states: Sequence[AdapterState]) -> RuntimeHealth`

Priority-ordered rules:

1. **Empty sequence** → `FAILED`. Zero adapters means the runtime has no routing capability.
2. **All states are `READY`** → `HEALTHY`. Every adapter is fully operational.
3. **All states are `FAILED`** → `FAILED`. No routing capability remains.
4. **At least one `READY` and at least one non-`READY` state** → `DEGRADED`. The runtime operates with reduced capacity.
5. **No `READY` states, but at least one operational non-`FAILED` state** (`DEGRADED`, `BACKPRESSURED`, `DISCONNECTED`) → `DEGRADED`. The runtime has partial capability.
6. **`INITIALIZING` states only** → `FAILED`. Adapters not yet started are not operational.
7. **`STOPPING` states** → treated as non-operational (not `READY`, not `FAILED`).

These rules are pure, deterministic, and transport-agnostic. They depend only on `AdapterState` values.

## 2. Adapter Failure Severity

### 2.1 AdapterFailureSeverity Enum

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `FATAL` | The adapter failure makes the runtime inoperable. All adapters are down. |
| `NON_FATAL` | The adapter failure degrades the runtime, but at least one adapter remains operational. |

### 2.2 Classification Rule

`classify_adapter_failure_severity(healthy_count: int, total_count: int) -> AdapterFailureSeverity`

- `healthy_count == 0` and `total_count > 0` → `FATAL`
- `healthy_count > 0` → `NON_FATAL`
- `total_count == 0` → `FATAL` (zero adapters, no capability)

**Key invariant:** When `classify_runtime_health()` is supplied with one `FAILED` and one `READY` adapter state, the result is `DEGRADED` rather than `FAILED`. This classification invariant ensures a single adapter failure is correctly identified as non-fatal when other adapters remain operational. The runtime does not actively transition states in response to adapter failures — callers supply the adapter states to classify.

## 3. Startup Outcome Semantics

### 3.1 StartupOutcome Enum

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `SUCCESS` | All configured adapters started successfully. Runtime is `HEALTHY`. |
| `PARTIAL` | Some adapters started, some failed. Runtime is `DEGRADED`. This is allowed. |
| `TOTAL_FAILURE` | Zero adapters started. Runtime is `FAILED`. This is a startup failure. |

### 3.2 Classification Rule

`classify_startup_outcome(started: int, failed: int, total: int) -> StartupOutcome`

- `started == 0` and `total > 0` → `TOTAL_FAILURE`
- `started > 0` and `failed > 0` → `PARTIAL`
- `started == total` → `SUCCESS`
- `total == 0` → `TOTAL_FAILURE` (nothing configured, nothing started)

**Key invariant:** Partial startup is allowed. The runtime enters `DEGRADED` state. Only total startup failure (zero adapters started) is fatal.

## 4. Runtime Diagnostics Aggregation

The supervision module provides a diagnostics snapshot hook:

`runtime_supervision_snapshot(adapter_states: Sequence[AdapterState]) -> dict[str, Any]`

Returns a JSON-safe dictionary containing:
- `runtime_health`: The classified `RuntimeHealth` value as a string.
- `adapter_summary`: Counts by state category (`healthy`, `degraded`, `failed`, `other`).
- `startup_fingerprint`: Deterministic description of the adapter state distribution.

This is observational only. It does not trigger restarts, alerts, or state changes.

## 5. Architectural Boundaries

The following boundaries are enforced by tests:

| Module | Must NOT import | May import |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| `medre.core.runtime.supervision` | Transport SDKs (`nio`, `meshtastic`, `meshcore`, `RNS`, `lxmf`), concrete adapter packages | `medre.core.lifecycle.states`, `medre.adapters.base` (protocol types only) |
| `medre.core.runtime.diagnostics` | Transport SDKs, concrete adapter packages | `medre.core.runtime.health`, `medre.core.runtime.supervision` |
| `medre.core.runtime.health` | Transport SDKs, concrete adapter packages | `medre.adapters.base` (protocol types), `medre.core.lifecycle.states` |
| Snapshot code | Transport SDKs, concrete adapter packages | Runtime core modules only |
| Accounting code | Transport SDKs, concrete adapter packages | Runtime core modules only |
| Persistence contract | Transport SDKs, concrete adapter packages | Runtime core modules only |

## 6. Test Coverage Requirements

1. **Classification tests:** `RuntimeHealth` classification for all meaningful combinations of `AdapterState` values.
2. **Failure severity tests:** `FATAL` when all adapters down, `NON_FATAL` when some remain.
3. **Startup outcome tests:** `SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL`, `TOTAL_FAILURE` for edge cases.
4. **Boundary tests:** Import-line analysis ensuring no transport SDK or concrete adapter package leakage.
5. **Fake adapters only:** No live transport dependencies in any supervision test.

## 7. Deferred

The following are explicitly out of scope:

- Automatic adapter restart manager
- Supervisor tree / process respawn
- Admin API / REST / TUI / daemon manager
- Hot reload of adapters
- Distributed orchestration
- Transport redesign
- Canonical event redesign
- Health polling / circuit breakers / auto-degrade logic
